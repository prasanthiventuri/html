"DNS"
       The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.Humans access information online through domain names, 
like nytimes.com or espn.com.Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so 
browsers can load Internet resources.

IP address

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a series of numbers that identifies the physical location of a particular device on the Internet network.
 An IP address looks something like this: 74.125.19.147 Since a domain name can have one or more associated IP addresses, Google doesn't support email and web publishing configurations using IP addresses alone.
